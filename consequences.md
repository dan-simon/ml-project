This is all the information currently formulated on consequences. This whole mess will be cleaded up as more stuff is added.

The "rather broad consequences" mentioned are things like that the VC dimension of n-dimensional spheres is at least n + 1, that the VC dimension of polygons with n sides is at least 2n, that the VC dimension of translations of a n-dimensional bounded shape with nonempty interior is at least n, and other things of this sort.
